# MultiSim Simulator!
Manipulates all the input values of the "Digital Interactive Constant" in a multisim circuit and takes their screenshot.
In other words, this application sends keystrokes to multisim :P

# Attention!
This project is in BETA, but the fact that it works is amazing.
I've NOT disassembled / loaded any dll's, in fact, we don't need to touch the internals of Multisim.

# Usage:
0. Start Multisim and make your circuit.
1. For each "Digital Interactive Constant" placed, assign a unique letter to the key in its properties. (except the SPACE key)
2. Download and execute ``MultiSim-Simulator.exe`` from the releases section.
3. Now, enter the number of inputs in the program.
4. For each input, enter the previously assigned character in the digital constant.
5. Now, in multisim, initialise all digital constants to zero.
6. Adjust the window size and zoom it in / out (for the screenshot).
7. Do not touch multisim after pressing ENTER key (you can touch other windows xD).
8. Check your output screenshots in the output folder ``Simulations-XXXX`` (XXXX is a random number and is displayed in the program)

Feel free to post your issues.
